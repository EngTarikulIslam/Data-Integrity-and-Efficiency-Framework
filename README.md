# Data-Integrity-and-Efficiency-Framework
The 'Data Integrity &amp; Efficiency' framework combines bit/character stuffing with Hamming code parity checks to enhance reliable data transmission. This dual approach minimizes errors while optimizing throughput across communication channels, ensuring accurate delivery through robust error detection and correction mechanisms.
